### Week 3: Monday 12th October – Sunday 18th October 
During this week we first met and introduced ourselves to each other, established our group name, ethos and logo and assigned team roles, completing tasks 1+ 2. We didn’t create the github organisation (task 7) as scheduled for this week, however this shouldn’t affect the progress of the project as this task isn’t in the critical path.

### Week 4: Monday 19th October – Sunday 25th October
In this week we had our initial team-customer meeting and began to elicit game requirements. We also began some game design as we had elicited the games functional requirements. We didn’t finish requirements elicitation (task 3) in this week as we had planned, however in reality we found task 4 didn’t depend on the completion of task 3, meaning we could start this task early.  This week we also completed task 7 (created the github organisation.)<br>

### Week 5: Monday 26th October – Sunday 1st November
In this week we completed our requirements elicitation and finished our game design. With task 3 and 4 both completed we are back in line with the schedule outlined in our initial plans. <br>

### Week 6: Monday 2nd November – Sunday 8th November
In this week we began but didn’t finish abstract software architecture, again putting us slightly behind schedule as task 5 wasn’t completed.<br>

### Week 7: Monday 9th November – Sunday 15th November
This week we completed the abstract architecture (task 5) and made a start on task 6 (review of the architecture along with risk assessment and mitigation), however as we didn’t complete this task we were still left behind schedule at the end of this week.<br>

### Week 8: Monday 16th November – Sunday 22nd November 
We spent the beginning of this week completing task 6, which reduced the time we had left for implementation (task 8,) however we did still manage to make significant progress with the game implementation.<br>

### Week 9: Monday 23rd November – Wednesday 25th November 
This week we completed the initial game implementation, however due to the reduced timeframe some requirements were not met within this implementation. In this week we also completed task 9 (concrete architecture.) <br>
